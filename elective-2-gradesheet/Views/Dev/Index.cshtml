            As I work on this activity, I got the chance to learn more about this topic and how to create dynamic filter forms
            in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. I got to know what is this and how to use <code>asp-items</code> to fill dropdowns,
            handle form submissions, and even add a reset button to clear all inputs while keeping the page
            responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I try to follow the instructions and add the user interface using Bootstrap, like adding tooltips for student names
            and collapsible sections for activities. Seeing how JavaScript works with Razor to make the page
            more interactive was interesting.
        </p>

            For me this activity was quite challenging since I am still new to ASP.NET Core.
            At first, I was not sure where to start how to handle the reset functionality or the collapsible sections properly,
            but sir Alamao provided clear instructions which really helped me follow along step by step.

            To Sum Up, this Lab Activity gave me a help me understand more of ASP.NET Core MVC, Razor syntax, and
            integrating elements with JavaScript. Even though it was a bit hard.
